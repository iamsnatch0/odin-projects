    <p>Pasta dinners are an easy go-to option year-round but when summertime comes, I want none of the heavy sauces and especially nothing canned in mine. One of my favorite ways to recreate an Italian summer’s evening at home is to go back to the classics like Spaghetti alle Vongole which truly emphasizes the ‘less is more’ approach. It’s one of the lightest pasta dish I know, one of the easiest as well, and with only a 
    few simple ingredients you’ll be tasting the Mediterranean Sea in no time!</p>

    <p>Like most of the classic pasta dishes, there are a lot of versions out there for Spaghetti alle Vongole though I’m definitely a fan of the one called ‘in bianco’, meaning no tomatoes are added. I have nothing against tomatoes per se but here all I want is to taste the perfect balance of plump briny clams, white wine, lots of garlic and spicy red chili flakes. As with any simple dish, quality ingredients are key 
    so get the best fresh clams you can find and open a nice bottle of wine.</p>

    <ul class="carb-ul"><h2 class="title-2"><em>Spaghetti Alle Vongole Ingredients</em></h2>
        <li class="carb-li">400g spaghetti</li>
        <li class="carb-li">1kg fresh vongole (clams), cleaned and scrubbed</li>
        <li class="carb-li">3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li class="carb-li">1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li class="carb-li">1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li class="carb-li">A pinch of red pepper flakes (optional, for a little heat)</li>
        <li class="carb-li">Fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li class="carb-li">1 lemon (optional, for zest or juice)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol class="carb-oll"><h2 class="title-2"><em>Making The Spaghetti Alle Vongole Step By Step </em></h2>
        <li class="carb-ol"><strong>Prepare the clams:</strong> If you haven't done so already, scrub the clams under cold water and soak them in 
        salted water for at least 30 minutes to remove any sand. Drain before using.</li>
        <li class="carb-ol"><strong>Cook the spaghetti:</strong>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti according to the package directions, usually around 8-9 minutes for al dente.
         Reserve about a cup of pasta water and then drain the spaghetti.</li>
        <li class="carb-ol"><strong>Sauté the garlic:</strong> While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in 
        a large pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and sauté it until fragrant and golden (be careful not to burn it).</li>
        <li class="carb-ol"><strong>Cook the clams: </strong>Add the clams to the pan and pour in the white wine. Cover with a lid and cook for about 5-7 minutes, 
        or until the clams have opened up. Discard any that remain closed.</li>
        <li class="carb-ol"><strong>Combine the pasta and clams:</strong> Add the drained spaghetti to the pan with the clams. Toss everything together, adding a bit of the reserved pasta water if the dish seems too dry. 
        Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes, if using.</li>
        <li class="carb-ol"><strong>Finish and serve:</strong> Sprinkle chopped parsley over the top and serve immediately. Optionally, you can add a little lemon zest or juice for extra freshness.</li>
    
    </ol>
