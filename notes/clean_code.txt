What is clean code?
Consider the following examples:

Example A:

const x= function (z){
   const w = "Hello ";
return w +  z

 }

x("John");

Example B:
const generateUserGreeting = function (name) {
  const greeting = "Hello ";
  return greeting + name;
};

generateUserGreeting("John");

Example B represents cleaner code. While you may not know what each part does, it’s much easier to guess what’s happening because the functions and variables are named clearly. 
The indentation and spacing follow a consistent and logical pattern.
